# Check installed firmware version

Find out what firmware version is currently flashed on your IoT board by running a few Linux commands directly on the Intel® Edison board.

1. Establish an SSH or serial connection to the Intel® Edison.

  _Don't know how? Refer to [Shell Access](/shell_access/)._

2. Run the `configure_edison` command with the `--help` flag to figure out the right approach for your board based on the output of this command.

  ```
  configure_edison --help
  ```

  **Get a "configure_edison: not found" message?**

  !["configure_edison: not found" message](images/configure_edison-not_found.png)

  Your board's firmware is very out of date. [Update the firmware »](manually.md)

  ---

  **Do not see a "--version" flag in the command list?**

  Your board's firmware is out of date. [Update the firmware »](manually.md)

  ![The screenshot on the left is missing the --version and --latest-version flags. ](images/configure_edison-no_version.png)

3. If you see a "--version" flag and your Intel® Edison is online via the onboard Wi-Fi, run the `configure_edison` command with the `--version` flag, followed by the `--latest-version` flag.

  ```
  configure_edison --version; configure_edison --latest-version
  ```

  If the outputted numbers are the **same**, your board is up to date.

  ![Running a version comparison shows this board has the same version as the latest](images/configure_edison-version_comparison.png)

  In this example, the build version on the board is "120" and the latest is "120".

  ---

  **Is the first version number (yours) lower than the second (latest) version?**

  If so, your board's firmware is out of date. You may want to [update the firmware »](manually.md)

  In this example, the build version on the board is "16" but the latest is "17".

  ---

4. If the `--latest-version` flag is not available because **your board is offline**, use the `cat` command to print out the text in the "/etc/version" file on the Intel® Edison.

  ```
  cat /etc/version
  ```

  ---

  **See a build version number less than 120?**

  If you see something similar to "edison-weekly_build_56_2014-08-20_15-54-05", the build version number is 56.

  If you do not see "weekly-120" or higher outputted, your firmware is out of date. Continue to Update the firmware to enable all the newest features.

---

**Does the "Yocto complete image" file name on the Intel® Edison Software Downloads page indicate the build version?**

No, there is no direct naming correlation.

For example, the file name "edison-image-ww05-15.zip" means that this image was released the 5th week of the year 2015. Whereas "weekly-120" is what would be output when `configure_edison --version` is run with this image.
