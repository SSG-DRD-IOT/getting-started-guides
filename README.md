## Branches

### branch: master

[github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides)

This is the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) templating source code to produce the static html files for both the 'gh-pages' and 'html' branches.

Make changes to this branch only. If you try updating 'html' or 'gh-pages', your changes **will** be overwritten.

### branch: html

[github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/html](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/html)

This is the branch that can be downloaded and put on USB keys for Roadshows. **HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR STABLE RELEASES, THEY WILL BE TAGGED AND CAN BE FOUND HERE: [https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/releases](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/releases)**

Static files need to be generated form the 'master' branch. See [the branch's README](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/blob/html/README.md) for details on viewing files.

#### Making releases

1. Go to [https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/releases](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/releases).
2. Click "Draft a new release" button.
3. In new screen:
    1. Make the tag version related to the date (e.g. "2015-Dec-9)
    2. Make the target 'html'
    3. Make the release title related to the update (e.g. "Intel XDK v2571 updates") or the Roadshow (e.g. "Toronto Roadshow").
    4. Add a description
    5. Finally, click "Publish release"


### branch: gh-pages

[github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/gh-pages)

Github's built in web server for viewing html files: [intel-iot-roadshow.github.io/getting-started-guides/](http://intel-iot-roadshow.github.io/getting-started-guides/). Feel free to send anyone to this url if they are unable to get the USB key files working. Static files need to be generated form the 'master' branch.


## Installation

You will need to have Jekyll (and Ruby) installed to preview the site on your computer and to build the static html files.

```
gem install jekyll
```

## Previewing site locally

Run the following command, then visit http://localhost:4000/.

```
jekyll serve
```

Alternatively:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```


## Building static html files

```
jekyll build
```

Generated files end up in a folder named `_site`. Copy the contents of _site in order to commit new files to the 'html' branch.


## Building static html files for gh-pages

```
jekyll build --config _config.gh-pages.yml
```

The extra flag uses a config file that includes "/getting-started-guides" (which is the name of this Github repo) as a base url instead of "" or "/" in order to make it compatible when viewing on the github.io domain.

Generated files end up in the `_site` folder too. Copy the contents of _site in order to commit new files to the 'gh-pages' branch. Once commits have been pushed to 'gh-pages', the docs can be viewed at [intel-iot-roadshow.github.io/getting-started-guides/](http://intel-iot-roadshow.github.io/getting-started-guides/)
