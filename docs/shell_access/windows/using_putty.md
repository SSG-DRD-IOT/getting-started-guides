## Cancel/exit an already submitted command

If you submitted a command and it is taking a long time to complete, or you do not want to complete it, quit the process using Ctrl+C.

1. Make sure the PuTTY terminal window has focus.

2. Type **Ctrl+C** to send a break command.


## Save connection settings for re-use

To quickly connect to the same IoT board the next time, save the session settings.

1. Enter in your serial connection details, including serial line and speed.

2. Under "Saved Sessions", enter a descriptive name for your session presets. Then click "Save".
