1. Once the archive file is extracted, go into the resulting <span class="icon folder">iotdk-ide</span> directory.

2. Double-click on <span class="icon file">devkit-launcher</span> to launch the IoT dev kit Eclipse IDE.

    On Windows, you may need to right-click on <span class="icon file">devkit-launcher.bat</span> and select "**Run as administrator**".

    You should see a command line window appear (and quickly disappear, if you are on Windows) and the Eclipse IDE will launch.

3. After launching Eclipse, you will need to select a folder to become your Eclipse workspace for project files.
