1. If you do not know if you have Java installed, refer to [How can I find which version of Java is installed without running an applet in Windows or Mac?](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml) on java.com for instructions.

2. If you do not have Java installed, download the Oracle distribution of a Java JRE or JDK from [oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
