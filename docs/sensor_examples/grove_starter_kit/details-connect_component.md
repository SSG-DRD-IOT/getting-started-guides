1. Choose a component from the Grove System.

    In this example, the Grove LED Socket is being used.

    <!-- See [Programming Grove components](#programming-grove-components) to help choose a component from the Grove Starter Kit. -->

2. Use a 4-pin Grove Cable and connect one end of the cable to the component.

    The cable connectors only fit in one direction so you can be confident that the wiring is correct.

3. For the other end of the cable, refer to the the Grove Base Shield labels for the correct pin to connect to based on the component chosen.

    * Digital pins (D2-D8)
    * Analog pins (A0-A3)
    * I2C (bottom row)
    * UART (top right)
