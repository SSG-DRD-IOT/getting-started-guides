## Host mode USB cable

Use the standard-sized USB port in USB host mode to allow the IntelÂ® Edison to accept USB peripherals such as mice, keyboards, etc.

1. Find the **microswitch** in between the USB ports on the expansion board. 
Switch the microswitch ***up*** towards the standard-sized USB port, if it isn't already.

2. Plug in the DC power supply to the barrel connector since USB host mode **requires** the use of an external power adapter.

3. Plug a USB peripheral with a standard-sized USB connector into the USB port above the microswitch on the expansion board.
