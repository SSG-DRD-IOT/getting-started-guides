## Build and run a sample application

The version of Eclipse distributed with the developer kit has some example projects already built in. To start, build a blinking LED project from a pre-existing sample.

---

1. If not already selected, click the "**C/C++**" tab in the top right corner of the Eclipse screen.

  *The application list order moves around so "4_cpp_onboard_LED_blink Debug" may appear anywhere in the drop down list. Look carefully.*

7. A password dialog will appear. If you have not configured your board with a different user ID and password, enter "root" for the "User ID" and leave the "Password" field empty. Click "**OK**" when done.

  **Intel® Edison only: Do you get a "Failed to connect sshd" error message?**

  If your Intel® Edison is using a WiFi connection, you must have a password set on your board otherwise you will get a SSH connection error. To set a password, connect to your Intel® Edison via a serial connection and run:

  ```
  configure_edison --password
  ```

7. The following authentication warning will appear. Click "**Yes"** to proceed. You should only see this warning once.

8. Your compiled project code will be transferred over to the Intel® Edison's or Intel® Galileo's onboard memory and run. 

  Look in the "Console" panel for any program messages.
